### Making use of the Jupyter notebook

The database can be populated without the use of the notebook. For a proper 
functioning of the notebook, Jupyter Notebook must run *inside* the virtual 
environment. An easy way to achieve this is by installing Jupyter Notebook 
within the activate venv like so:
```
pip install notebook
```

The notebook can then be started easily through:
```
jupyter notebook project_template.ipynb
```
